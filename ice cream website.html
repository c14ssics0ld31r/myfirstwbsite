  <i>A no-bake, frozen cake made from ice cream sandwiches and a couple of other
    tasty ingredients, this is an Ice Cream Sandwich Cake!<br>This Recipe</i>
  <i>takes a fraction of the time that a homemade ice cream cake would
     take and yet it still tastes absolutely amazing.
     Dress it up with rosettes of cool</i> <br>
  <i> whip, chocolate syrup, and peanuts, or keep it
     simple, either way, youâ€™ll have a killer cake perfect for birthdays,
     summer BBQâ€™s or just because!</i>
  <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
  <p>Gather up these <b>6 ingredients</b> and a <b>9x9 baking dish</b>
  to get started. Here's what you'll need to make an Ice Cream Sandwich Cake:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Ice Cream Sandwiches</b>: the beauty of this recipe is you can adapt
       it easily into any flavors you like! There are neopolitan, cookies and
       <br /> cream, all chocolate and all vanilla ice cream sandwiches
       available. I used the vanilla flavor!</li>
       <li><b>Ice Cream</b>: I used Moose Tracks but feel free to use another
         flavor of ice cream!</li>
       <li><b>Peanut Butter</b>: this is optional,especially if you are
         allergic! This is layered inetween the ice cream sandwiches and adds
         such a yummy<br> nutty flavor.</li>
       <li><b>Cool Whip</b>: this tops off the whole thing. I also make this
         cake pretty by piping rossetes on top!</li>
       <li><b>Chocolate Syrup</b>: this adds a yummy drizzle to the top. Feel
         free to use magic chocolate shell instead.</li>
       <li><b>Peanuts</b>: once again, optional but super yummy. You can replace
          this with chocolate chips, mini M&M's crushed Oreos or sprinkles.</li>

  </ul>
  <h2 id="process">How to make Ice Cream Sandwich cake</h2>
  <p>For full details on how to make this Ice Cream Sandwich Cake, see the recipe
    card down below ðŸ™‚</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Prep Pan</b>: Line a 9Ã—9 or 8Ã—8 square pan with foil.</li>
    <li><b>Layer Ingredients</b>: Open 6 ice cream sandwiches and fit them into
      the bottom of the pan, cutting where necessary.</li> <ul>
      <li>Itâ€™s ok if they donâ€™t fit perfectly.</li>
      <li>Any holes you can fill with ice cream.</li>
      <li>Spread ice cream in an even layer across the top of the ice cream
        sandwiches.</li>
      <li>Be sure to press any additional ice cream into any holes not filled by
        ice cream sandwiches.</li>
      <li>Drizzle the top of the ice cream with peanut butter and top with the
        remaining ice cream sandwiches.</li>
      <li>Fill any gaps with extra ice cream.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Freeze:</b>Cover and freeze for at least 3 hours to solidify.</li>
    <li><b>Decorate!</b>Remove from pan using foil and unwrap. Place onto serving
      platter. Spread the exterior of the cake with Cool Whip.
      Drizzle the <br> top with chocolate sauce and sprinkle with chopped peanuts.
      Use any additional cool whip in a piping bag fitted with a large star tip
      (I used <br> Wilton 1M). Add rosettes to the top of the cake and sprinkle
      with more chopped peanuts. Store in the freezer until ready to serve.
      Cut into 16 <br> even pieces and serve.</li>
      <br>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="how to store">How to Store an Ice Cream Sandwich Cake</h2>
  <p>Another huge perk of this Ice Cream Sandwich Cake is that it is so easy
     to store! Whether you plan to make this ahead of time or are just
     saving <br> leftovers, Iâ€™ve got you covered.</p>
  <h3>Make-Ahead</h3>
  <p>If youâ€™re making this recipe ahead of time, Iâ€™d suggest storing it before
    decorating the top. You can do this for up to a week! Then when youâ€™re <br> ready
    to serve, remove the cake from the baking dish, and decorate with cool whip
    and toppings.</p>
  <h3>Saving leftovers</h3>
  <p>Storing after decorating can be a little more difficult but itâ€™s not
    impossible! Skip the rosettes or simply scrape them off if youâ€™re saving
    leftovers.<br> Return to a freshly lined baking dish and cover the top with
    plastic wrap then foil. Freeze for up to two weeks. The second method wonâ€™t
    be as <br> pretty but youâ€™ll be able to enjoy the leftovers of this treat after
    your big event is over.</p>

    <p>Once again, feel free to change up this recipe to suit your wants! Go make
    this Ice Cream Sandwich Cake before summer is over ðŸ™‚</p>
